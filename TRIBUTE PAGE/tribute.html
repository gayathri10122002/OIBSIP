    <p class="para">Zayn Malik was born in Bradford, England, to Tricia (Brannan) and Yaser Malik, and is of Pakistani (father) and English-Irish (mother) descent. He had an early love for singing and performing, and at the age of 17 he competed in the television competition The X Factor. After judges Nicole Scherzinger and Simon Cowell grouped him with fellow competitors Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson to form a new act, One Direction became one of the most popular finalists in their season of The X Factor.Following the band's massive success, Malik left the group in 2015 to pursue a solo career. ZAYN signed with RCA Records and moved to Los Angeles, where he began working on his solo effort with James "Malay" Ho (Frank Ocean, Big Boi). His debut single, "Pillowtalk," was released in late January 2016 and debuted at #1 on the Billboard charts and his full-length debut album Mind of Mine was released on March 25, 2016.<br>
